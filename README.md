This repo collects and collates data across different news sites to achieve 2 objectives:
1. To identify the common public sentiments regarding mpox
2. To understand which words are commonly associated with mpox

This analysis can then be used to help health officials cater their mpox awareness campaigns to the public.

NewsAPI was used to collect the latest 100 articles in english containing the word "mpox". There are 2 visualisation techniques used to display the data. 
A pie chart (partially developed) is used to display the results of our sentiment analysis, while a word cloud (fully developed) is used to show which words are most commonly used in association to mpox.
Both of these charts were made with D3.js.

Wordcloud: https://mpox-sentiments.onrender.com/wordcloud

Note: These charts were used as part of a project for the module IS428 - Visual Analytics for Business Intelligence
